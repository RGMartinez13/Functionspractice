#Our function does a really good job of welcoming anyone who is traveling to Times Square
#but a really poor job if they are going anywhere else. 
#In order for us to make our function a bit more dynamic, we are going to use the concept of function parameters.
#Function parameters allow our function to accept data as an input value. 
#We list the parameters a function takes as input between the parentheses of a function ( ).
